## [Mountain Chat]

I love a good mountain. The bigger, the better! Lately, it's felt as though I spend more time searching for the best runs of the day, rather than actually skiing. The purpose of this app is to introduce a posting forum for individual trails, allowing skiers (and snowboarders) access to live, trustworthy condition reports.

Mountain Chat is built using Ruby on Rails with a Postgresql database. I also hope to explore new front-end development strategies to focus on mobile UI.

The web application has been deployed using Heroku. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
